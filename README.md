# 🛒 E-Commerce Platform (Mobile + .NET Backend)

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a complete **E-Commerce Platform** consisting of a **Kotlin Mobile App** as the frontend and a **.NET REST API** as the backend.  
The project was developed as part of a university course for **Mobile Application Development**.  

I was responsible for designing and developing the **backend system**, which powers the entire platform using a **3-Tier Architecture** to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clean separation of concerns.

## 🏗️ Architecture  
The backend follows a **3-Tier Architecture**:  
- **Presentation Layer** – REST API Controllers (ASP.NET Core)  
- **Business Layer (BLL)** – Implements business rules and validation  
- **Data Access Layer (DAL)** – Communicates with the database using EF Core  

This architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns and makes the project easy to maintain and extend
